# School_District_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the overall budget and student performance data in order to organize for evaluation during a district meeting.  Overall the data was manipulated to determine if there is a correlation between the amount of money spent per student and improved math and reading score.

  •	How is the district summary affected?
	
    o	The district summary was not affected due to changing the number of students. 
    
  •	How is the school summary affected?
	
    o	The school summery are very close to the previous summary for the schools.  
		
  •	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
	
    o	There wasn’t much of a change and Thomas High School continues to be in the top 5 of schools.

•	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

		o	Math and reading scores by grade
		
				By grade it changes the number of students and has a nan value for the 9th graders for the Thomas High School
			
		o	Scores by school spending
		
				School spending is the same due to having to not changing the amount of students in the school.  The money was still spent on all the schools, but the 					math and reading scores were compromised.
			
		o	Scores by school size

				School size continues to be the same.

		o	Scores by school type
		
				School type again is the same due to Thomas High School having good overall grades even with the compromised data in the 9th grade removed.
